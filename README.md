# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to Machine Learning Projects! In this repository, we try to put all kinds of projects that are related to the field of machine learning and deep learning so that you have a complete reference for training, practice, and easy use. We started with easy projects such as linear regression, pre-processing, etc. and we will complete this work with higher level projects, of course, there may be no completion and we will do projects here forever :)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Once you have the project files on your local machine, you can begin exploring the data and experimenting with different machine learning algorithms.
## Prerequisites

Before you can use this project, you'll need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You'll also need to have the following Python packages installed:


numpy

pandas

matplotlib

scikit-learn



## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages for you.


    
## Optimizations

PLease change dataset and model for predicting!


## Usage/Examples

```python
# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Import the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('YOUR_DATASET.CSV')
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values

# Spliting dataset
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
```
